# Geography-Flag-Game
This game is for a SACE Stage 1 formative project, where students need to create a learning-based game for a target audience, with free choice on the topic or the subject. It is written in javascript.

# Problem Definition
Currently, there aren't nearly enough flag learning/geography resources publicly and easily available, nor do many younger students get taught a wide variety of countries and their flags. This game is aimed towards those younger school students, in years 6-9, to give them an introduction to the variety of nations in the world, and their flags.

**Outcomes**
1. Create a functioning menu to start a game
2. Enable the user to choose 3 different difficulty levels
3. Display 30 different flags for the user to guess
4. Record the points a user has scored, depending on which flags they guessed correct or incorrect
5. End screen with replay functions
